Introduction
============

The OpenHW Group CV32E20, or simply E20, is a RISC-V processor core that
is targeted for the ultra-low-end of the 32-bit microcontroller (MCU)
application space. Likely uses include any “constrained compute socket”
or as the processor element in embedded SoC subsystems.

The core design was originally developed as the PULPino *ZeroRISCY*
processor by ETH Zürich and the University of Bologna and later enhanced
by the lowRISC consortium as the *Ibex* core. For this project, the Ibex
design description is copied and further enhanced by the OpenHW Group.
The design is qualified using the industrial-strength
Core-V-Verification methodologies. The source RTL code is written in
SystemVerilog and maintained by the OpenHW Group.

This specification is organized as requirements that apply to the “Scope
of the IP”. The Revision 0.1 of this requirements document is intended
to specify the “Version 1” E20 design – there are already plans for
subsequent enhancements that will be included in a Version 2 (and
possibly beyond) design releases. Subsequent revision numbers are
placeholders for these enhancements after the initial project freeze
(PF) gate.

The requirement list is to be approved by the OpenHW Group Technical
Work Group (TWG), as well as any subsequent change requests.

The specification is complemented by a user’s guide.

*A list of abbreviations is available at the end of this document.*

This development is co-sponsored by NXP and Intrinsix, a wholly owned
subsidiary of CEVA.

Scope
=====

Scope of the IP
---------------

The **scope of the IP** is the processor core subsystem that is
specified below and that is verified with a 100% coverage goal. In the
verification plans, the scope of the IP can be partitioned into two DUTs
(designs under test) - one covering the processor core itself, and a
“\ **coreplex**\ ” covering the processor “core complex” which adds
debug capabilities, an interrupt controller and system bus protocol
wrappers to the E20 core.

The scope of the IP is the **CV32E20 hardware** supporting all the
features used in products based on the E20 core. A high-level block
diagram of the E20 core is shown below:

.. image:: ../03_reference/images/blockdiagram.svg
  :alt: CV32E20 Blockdiagram

As displayed in this core block diagram, the E20 is a 2-stage pipelined
implementation featuring a 32-bit Harvard memory architecture for
independent instruction fetch and data load/store interfaces. The first
pipeline stage is the instruction fetch (IF), while the second stage is
the Instruction Decode and Execute (ID/EX).

As displayed in the above figure, the IP comprises:

-  The CV32E20 processor core with dual 32-bit Harvard memory interfaces

   -  Instruction fetch bus, data load/store bus

   -  Support for both RV32I (32 x 32b GPRs) and RV32E (16 x 32b GPRs)

   -  Support for ISA extensions: C (compressed) and M (multiply &
      divide)

   -  Support for basic set of Configuration & Status Registers (CSRs)

-  Dual 32-bit Harvard memory interfaces

   -  Supported core protocol is OBI_1_v1.2 (Open Bus Interface)
      definition

At the coreplex design level, the following functions are added to the
processor core:

-  Debug module including the DTM

-  Interrupt module

-  System bus wrappers to convert from OBI to the AMBA-AHB (Advanced
   Microcontroller Bus Architecture, Advanced High-performance Bus)
   protocol

In addition to these main configurations, multiple fine grain parameters
are available.

Unless otherwise stated, optional features are controlled by
SystemVerilog parameters. If not selected, each optional feature is not
present in the netlist after synthesis. The reader’s attention is drawn
to the difference between an optional feature (“...\ *shall* support as
an option...”) versus a desired goal (“...\ *should* support...”,
“...\ *should* reduce latency...”).

The following topics are beyond the scope of this specification:

-  Software (SW layers), such as compilers, assemblers and OSes
   (although these could be part of the OpenHW Group CV32E20 project)

-  Software emulation of RISC-V optional extensions (feasible but the
   scope of the IP is the core and coreplex hardware)

-  Other features included in the testbench (main memory, firmware,
   interconnect…), the coverage of which are not measured

Golden configurations
---------------------

It is not possible to verify all 2\ :sup:`n` combinations of design
parameters. Below is the list of golden configurations that will undergo
verification in the project and their main parameters. The full list of
parameters for each golden configuration are detailed in the user guide.

CSR hardware performance counters
---------------------------------

For the performance monitor counters, the default CSR configuration for
the CV32E20 core implements the two 64-bit cycle and
inst(ructions)ret(ired) counters along with the 32-bit mcountinhibit
register.

The 64-bit counters are accessed using CSRR instructions separately
reading the upper and lower 32-bit values. A 4-instruction loop can be
used to provide a fully coherent 64-bit register read that provides
protection against any “race condition” involving an overflow from the
lower order 32-bit register.

| NOTE   | It should be mentioned that the event associated with         |
|        | mphm{event,counter}11 has a different definition for the E20  |
|        | core versus Ibex. This counter no longer tracks multiply      |
|        | cycles, but rather, the cycles when the core is quiescent in  |
|        | the ‘wait for interrupt’ state.                               |

Interface requirements
======================

CV32E20 core memory bus
-----------------------

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-10 | CV32E20 core shall support a Harvard memory interface with  |
|        | two 32-bit OBI interfaces, one for instruction fetch and a  |
|        | second for data loads & stores. Each bus includes a 32-bit  |
|        | byte address and dual 32-bit buses for read and write data. |
|        | Data references support 8-bit byte, 16-bit halfword and     |
|        | 32-bit word elements.                                       |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

CV32E20 coreplex memory bus
---------------------------

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-20 | The CV32E20 coreplex shall support a Harvard memory         |
|        | interface with two 32-bit AMBA-AHB5 interfaces, one for     |
|        | instruction fetch and a second for data loads & stores.     |
|        | Each bus includes a 32-bit byte address and dual 32-bit     |
|        | buses for read and write data. Data references support      |
|        | 8-bit byte, 16-bit halfword and 32-bit word elements.       |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-21 | The CV32E20 coreplex also shall support a 32-bit AMBA-AHB5  |
|        | interface from the debug module to allow real-time debug    |
|        | access to system memory.                                    |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-30 | The CV32E20 coreplex shall support unaligned (also known as |
|        | *misaligned*) data accesses for the E20 core by generating  |
|        | 2 bus cycles to complete the memory reference. This         |
|        | capability requires individual byte strobes be supported in |
|        | the attached data memory.                                   |
|        |                                                             |
|        | If this capability cannot be supported, the coreplex shall  |
|        | support an optional hardware configuration where all        |
|        | unaligned data accesses are decomposed into combinations of |
|        | 8- and 16-bit transfers. This means the ‘worst-case’ data   |
|        | unalignment may require 3 bus cycles (byte, halfword, byte) |
|        | to complete.                                                |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-40 | The CV32E20 coreplex shall generate only SINGLE AHB         |
|        | transactions, that is, no BURST transactions are generated  |
|        | by the E20 core.                                            |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-50 | The CV32E20 coreplex AHB5 bus protocol shall support the    |
|        | following design interface parameters:                      |
|        |                                                             |

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-60 | The CV32E20 coreplex AHB5 bus protocol shall not support    |
|        | signaling associated with exclusive accesses – this implies |
|        | the HEXCL and HEXOKAY control signals are not used.         |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-70 | The CV32E20 coreplex AHB5 bus protocol shall encode the     |
|        | operating mode of every access using the {HNONSECURE,       |
|        | HPROT[1]} bus attribute signals defined as:                 |
|        |                                                             |

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEM-80 | The CV32E20 coreplex AHB5 bus protocol shall implement a    |
|        | 4-bit HPROT[*] bus attribute control where HPROT[3:2] is    |
|        | hardwired to 2’b00.                                         |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Debug
-----

+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| DBG-10  | CV32E20 shall implement the features outlined in Chapter 4 |
|         | of [RVdbg].                                                |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+

In addition, there can be an external debug module, not in the scope of
the IP.

Interrupts
----------

+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| IRQ-10  | CV32E20 shall implement interrupt handling registers as    |
|         | per the RISC-V privilege specification and interface with  |
|         | a CLIC implementation.                                     |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+

Coprocessor interface
---------------------

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| XIF-10 | For *subsequent* core implementations, CV32E20 shall        |
|        | support the coprocessor interface compliant with [CV-X-IF]  |
|        | to extend the supported instructions. The goal is a set of  |
|        | compatible interfaces between the CORE-V cores, for         |
|        | example, CV32E40{P,S,X}, CV32E20, …                         |
|        |                                                             |
|        | The initial version of CV32E20 shall not support the        |
|        | CV-X-IF coprocessor interface.                              |

PPA targets
===========

These PPA targets will be updated when physical design monitoring is
integrated in the continuous integration flow.

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| PPA-10 | CV32E20 should be resource optimized for both ASIC and FPGA |
|        | targets.                                                    |
|        |                                                             |
|        | In general, the relative priority of the PPA metrics is     |
|        | Power > Area > Performance. The project needs to determine  |
|        | how much to measure and minimize power dissipation -        |
|        | core/coreplex area provides a general proxy for power with  |
|        | numerous caveats.                                           |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| PPA-20 | CV32E20 should deliver more than x.y CoreMark/MHz           |
|        | performance when targeting RV32IMC for maximum performance, |
|        | for example, GCC -O3 compiler options and attached to zero  |
|        | wait-state instruction and data memories.                   |
|        |                                                             |
|        | This performance metric should be defined across multiple   |
|        | configuration variables like RV32{I,E}MC, compilers         |
|        | {GCC,LLVM} and compiler options {-O3, -Os/-Oz}. The core's  |
|        | operating environment is defined with attached zero         |
|        | wait-state instruction and data memories.                   |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| PPA-30 | CV32E20 should operate at more than ? MHz in the            |
|        | CV32E20\_?\_fpga configuration on Kintex 7 FPGA technology. |
|        |                                                             |
|        | Metric details to be supplied later.                        |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| PPA-50 | CV32E20 should operate at more than ? MHz in the            |
|        | CV32E20\_? configuration on 16-nm FFT technology in the     |
|        | worst-case frequency corner with the fastest threshold      |
|        | voltage.                                                    |
|        |                                                             |
|        | Metric details to be supplied later.                        |

Physical design rules
---------------------

As different teams have different design rules and flows, and to ease
the integration in FPGA and ASIC design flows:

+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| PDR-10  | CV32E20 should have a configurable global reset signal:    |
|         | synchronous/asynchronous, active high/low.                 |
|         |                                                            |
|         | For asynchronous resets, the assertion edge is treated as  |
|         | an asynchronous event; the negation edge is treated as a   |
|         | *synchronous* event.                                       |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| PDR-20  | CV32E20 shall be a “super-synchronous” design with a       |
|         | single clock input and all sequential elements operating   |
|         | on the pos-edge of the clock.                              |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| PDR-40  | CV32E20 should not include multi-cycle paths.              |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| PDR-50  | CV32E20 should not include technology-dependent blocks.    |
|         |                                                            |
|         | If technology-dependent blocks are used, e.g., to improve  |
|         | PPA on certain targets, the equivalent                     |
|         | technology-independent block should be available. A design |
|         | parameter can be used to select between the                |
|         | implementations.                                           |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| PDR-20  | For certain FPGA targets, CV32E20 may remove the reset in  |
|         | the RTL code.                                              |
|         |                                                            |
|         | See [FPGAreset] for background information on this         |
|         | requirement.                                               |
